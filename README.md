Small collection of content creation work. (*Currently in progress*)

## Content
I've been the "person who does the writing" for a *while*. Here's a small bit of what I can share.

**Head of Community, Rabbit**
The Help Center I created for my previous company, Rabbit, is now disabled (7/24/19). A few saved pieces can be found at:

## Presentations
Does anyone love Prezi as much as I do? Probably. I've used it for work, as well as for mapping out my thoughts in my free time.

**New Support Workflow**
Updated version of the workflow for user support at my previous company, Rabbit. This flow was implemented to more efficiently manage the increase in user feedback after the recent 4.0 release.
